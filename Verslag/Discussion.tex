\section{Discussion}
Looking back at our working process, we think we made some good choices.
For instance, we used the Barnes-Hut algorithm succesfully and the choice for Leapfrog integration was good due to its stability for oscillatory movements.\\

However, the results were really hard to get.
The simulations had a really long running time, even though we had implemented the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
Furthermore, we had to run all the simulations twice, since we noticed a small mistake in our code after the first simulations. 
Thus we need to check our code more often and maybe need to involve an algorithm that reduces the running time even more than Barnes-Hut.
Another option is avoiding the problem by using a faster computer.\\

For further research, it might be interesting to look after the influence of initial range where the bodies are places in the begin, because this will involve the distribution of gaseous planets even more.
Moreover, one can have a closer look at this distribution and improve it so it is more realistic.
Another option is expanding the system to a three-dimensional system.
One of the problems in this expansion is the direction of the initial velocities of the bodies.
